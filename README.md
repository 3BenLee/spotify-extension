Spotify mini player Chrome's exntesion

## Motivation

We spend most of our time on browser for working or enjoy reading news or looking for information. We rarely want to switch to another window because we are in focus mode. And if we don't have mood to listen some song or we want to pause. To do that, we have to switch to music app and make some actions that we want. Sometime switching context make us loose focus. So it happened to me. So I made this small extension to reduce the frequency of switching context.

## How it looks like?
