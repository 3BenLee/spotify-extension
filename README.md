## Motivation

We spend most of our time on browser for working, enjoy reading news or looking for information. We rarely want to switch to another window because we are in focus mode. Or while checking out youtube, some good melodies hit your ear and you may want to add that song to your Spotify playlist. To make things easier, this extension was born.

- Avoid switching context while you're focusing on your browser by providing mini player which helps to control Spotify easier on the browser.
- Quick right click to search song by name on Spotify site.
